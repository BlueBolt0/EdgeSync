🔹 Step 1: Decide Your Development Platform

Option A: Android Native (Kotlin/Java) → best if you want deep access to camera + system APIs.

Option B: Flutter (Dart) → cross-platform, faster UI building, but some advanced camera/AI features may need native plugins.
👉 Since your project involves camera + on-device AI, Android Native (Kotlin) is safer.

🔹 Step 2: Build the MVP (Core Flow)

Before thinking about all features, first build a basic working app:

1. Camera Integration

Use Android’s CameraX API.

Add a button to capture photos and store them locally.



2. Local Database (Room DB)

Save each photo with metadata (filename, timestamp, tags).



3. AI Processing (Document Detection / OCR)

Integrate ML Kit (Text Recognition / Object Detection).

When a photo is taken, run it through model → get text/tags.



4. Simple Suggestion Screen

Show a card like:

“Detected: Invoice” → Suggest “Add Reminder in Calendar”.

“Detected: Notes/Whiteboard” → Suggest “Save to Notes”.





👉 At this stage, you’ll already have a demo: Take photo → AI → Suggestion.

🔹 Step 3: Add Privacy Mode Camera

Use OpenCV to add reversible noise/adversarial patterns.

Store both original image (hidden) and noisy image (shown/stored).

Toggle button: Normal Mode / Privacy Mode.



---

🔹 Step 4: Add Cross-App Integration

Use Android Content Provider APIs to push data into:

Calendar (create reminders/events).

Notes (Google Keep or local DB notes).

Messaging (share intent).




---

🔹 Step 5: Natural Interaction Layer

Voice Commands: integrate Vosk/Whisper (offline speech-to-text).

Gesture Control: ML Kit for simple gestures (e.g., hand wave to trigger capture).



---

🔹 Step 6: UI/UX Polish

Clean interface with:

Camera → Processing → Suggestions → Action.

History tab (from Room DB).


Optional: Dark mode, animations, gesture shortcuts.
